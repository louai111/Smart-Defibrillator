## Overview

This project utilizes Arduino to build a defibrillator system that not only administers shock but also provides vital health monitoring features. It is equipped with ECG visualization, battery testing, and energy discharge testing capabilities. The defibrillator sends reports of these tests to biomedical engineers or technicians via email, ensuring timely maintenance and monitoring.

Additionally, the device includes a QR code placed on the defibrillator unit itself, which when scanned, opens a web-based 3D animation. This animation demonstrates the procedure for delivering a shock to a person in need of emergency defibrillation, enhancing accessibility to vital life-saving information.

Data from the system is displayed on a real-time ECG interface, allowing for effective cardiac monitoring. The integration of battery and energy tests ensures that the device is always in optimal working condition, and the automatic email notification feature helps technicians monitor the device's status remotely.
